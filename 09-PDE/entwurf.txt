//The idea is to implement a pipeline which is handing 3 different types of control information in two directions:
//upwards := previous process
//downwoards := following process

//Types of control information
//1. The maxresiduum is handed to the following processes so that the last process can decide when to terminate by precision
//2. The decision to terminate by precision is being handed "upwards" to the previous command.
//3. The actual iteration which is last calculated will be handed "downwards" so that every process ends at the same iteration.
